# caddy-webfinger
Simple hosting of a Webfinger endpoint via Caddy.

The main goal is to deploy the Webfinger endpoint in the simplest way: With files.

I needed a simple solution to deploy a WebFinger endpoint for use in the OIDC setup of [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) and connect to [Citadel](https://zitadel.com/).
